Access log of a room
Due to the distancing rules introduced to contain the COVID-19 epidemic in research laboratories, it is necessary to record accesses.

Therefore, a project that provides a simple access reservation software would be very useful.
The software must be able to be configured with an indefinite number of rooms, each room having a name, a maximum capacity, and a manager.
Registered users (preferably using the UNIMI sign-on service) can book their presence on the days they desire and in the rooms they have access to, but not exceeding a maximum number of concurrent bookings (a booking is no longer active when the current date is greater than the booking date).
